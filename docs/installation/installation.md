## **Installation**

**Parrot Stream** comes in two flavours, at the moment:

- a [**Cloudera Distribution**](cloudera-csds/index.html) for a production environment: you can easily distribute Parrot Stream as parcels into a **Cloudera Cluster** and manage it with [Cloudera Manager](https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-manager.html?). You can donwload Cloudera Manager and use it in its *Express Edition* to create and manage you cluster in a on premise configuration or you can setup a cluster deployment in [Amazon AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) or [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) with [Cloudera Director](https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-director.html).

- a [**Dockerized Distribution**](dockers/index.html) with all the necessary components to make the Parrot Stream up & running in minutes. This kind of distribution is intended just for development and testing purposes.
